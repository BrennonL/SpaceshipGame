# Overview

This project I wanted to practice using game design, classes and pygame. How this game works is there enemy spaceships that start at the beginning of the 
screen and make their way down. If any of them run into or shoot the player ship the player ship looses life. If the ships make it to the bottom the player also
looses points. The player uses the wsda keys to move and the space bar to shoot.

# Development Environment

I used python in vs code. I also used png images for the screen and wav sound for the music and background noise. 
I used pygame, os, time, and random libraries for this project.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* In the future I want to work on separating my classes into different files.
* The second thing I want to work on is transitioning from python to C# when I make games 
* The final thing I want to work on is designing my own ships and background, I think that would be supper fun!
